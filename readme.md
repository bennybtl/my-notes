# My Notes

I had a bunch of notes I was keeping in Google Keep, that no one else could see or use, so I decided to put many of them up on GitHub.com so maybe other could find them useful.

[starterHTML](./starterHTML) <br/>

it has a simple style sheet and **Jquery**
ready to run.

[Login Widget with CORS on PHP Server](./loginWidgetCorsOnPhp) <br/>
**CORS** configuration can be confusing when you first start, this is about as basic
of an example as I could create to show how to send a Bearer Token to a Server
via CORS.

[Javascript Promises](./javascriptPromises) <br/>
**Promises** Promises were a bit tricky for me, I used this over and over again until 
I felt comfortable with it. It also uses the ES5/6 **Fat Arrow** to abbreviate the functions.
