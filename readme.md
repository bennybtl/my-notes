# My Notes

I had a bunch of notes I was keeping in Google Keep, what no one else could see or use, so I decided to put many of them up on GitHub.com so maybe other could find them useful.

[starterHTML](./starterHTML) <br/>
When starting with HTML from Scratch, this what what I use,
it has a simple style sheet and Jquery
ready to run.

[Login Widget on JsFiddle](./loginWidgetJsfiddle) <br/>
I experiemented with successfully running the Okta Login Widget on JSFiddle, works great ! and perfect for training.

[Login Widget with CORS on PHP Server](./loginWidgetCorsOnPhp) <br/>
**CORS** configuration can be confusing when you first start, this is about as basic
of an example as I could create to show how to send a Bearer Token to a Server
via CORS.
